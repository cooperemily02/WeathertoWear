## General checklist before approving
- [ ] Avoided changes that are not related to the pull request
- [ ] Tests, if any, are passing
- [ ] Merged main **into your branch first (not the other way around)**
- [ ] Reviewed the checklist again **after the final changes and after merging main (or other upstream) into your branch**
- [ ] Reasonable merge strategy (**avoid adding non-descriptive commits to main**)
